<p>{% blocktrans %}For ready-only libraries or folders, Seafile will show a forbidden icon (<img src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}img/help/read_only.png" alt="" width="24" />) to indicate they are read-only. However, users can still modify the synced local copies. When a local copy is modified, Seafile will ignore the modified one. When the copy at the server is also modified, the client will popup a notification, saying that the local modified copy conflicts with the copy at the server side. To prevent data loss, the local copy is renamed to a conflict file.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
