<p>{% trans "You may have some very large libraries on the Seafile server. If you're currently only interested in a sub-folder inside one library, you can selectively sync this sub-folder instead of syncing the entire library. (This feature was only available in the Pro edition until client version 5.1.3)" %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}To sync a sub-folder, open cloud file browser by double clicking a library which hasn't been synced. Navigate into the parent folder of that sub-folder. Right click on the sub-folder. Choose "Sync this folder" in the pop-up menu.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
