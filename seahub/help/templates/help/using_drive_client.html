<h4>{% trans "FAQ" %}</h4>
<p><b>{% trans "1. Why can't I create new files or delete folders in root folder?" %}</b></p>
<p>{% trans "The root folder of the virtual drive contains only library folders. Seafile can only sync files inside libraries. Files in the root folder cannot be uploaded to Seafile server. So it doesn't make sense to support creating files in root folder. Since the top level folders in the virtual drive represents libraries, we don't want users to delete their libraries by mistake. So the Drive client doesn't support deleting top level folders." %}</p>
