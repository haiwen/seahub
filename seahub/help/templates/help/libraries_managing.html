<h3 class="hd">{% trans "Managing files with libraries" %}</h3>
<p>{% blocktrans %}Seafile uses "libraries" to organize your files. A library is a top level container for a set of files and folders. You can create a library for each project you work on, or each document type you want to save in Seafile. A library works mostly like a top level folder. But it also has some special properties:{% endblocktrans %}</p>
<ul>
  <li>{% trans "Each library keeps its own file modification history. There is no global file modification history across all libraries." %}</li>
  <li>{% trans "Each library can be synced to desktop clients separately. You can choose which libraries to be synced." %}</li>
</ul>
<p>{% blocktrans %}When you log into Seafile's web app for the first time, Seafile automatically creates a default library named "My Library" for you. You can also create more libraries. Here is what it looks like when you've created a few libraries.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}After <a href="{{ SITE_ROOT }}help/install_sync/">syncing a library with desktop client</a>, you can do any file operations inside the local library folder. The operations will be uploaded to the server. {% endblocktrans %}</p>
