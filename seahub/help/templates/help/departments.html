<p>{% trans "Some organizations consist of complex department hierarchy. There are usually two common use cases for file management in these organizations:" %}</p>
<ul>
  <li>{% trans "There should be a common file sharing space for the organization. The folder hierarchy should map the department hierarchy. There will be separate folder or space assigned to each department." %}</li>
  <li>{% trans "The sharing space should be owned and managed by the organization, but not individual employees. So that the ownership of files doesn't have to be changed when an employee leaves the organization." %}</li>
</ul>
<p>{% blocktrans %}The "Departments" feature is designed to meet the above two use cases. We'll introduce this feature from 3 different perspectives:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans "The system admin can set up the department hierarchy in two ways: manual setup or import from Active Directory." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "The system admin can create any number of top level departments and create any levels of sub-departments under each department. And each level of department can be populated with members. The system admin can set the role of each member to 'member' or 'admin'. We'll introduce how a department admin can manage department later." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "The system admin can also import the hierarchy from OUs (Organizational Units) in AD. Each OU will be imported as a department. And the sub-OUs under an OU will be imported as sub-departments. Department libraries can be automatically created in the import process." %}</p>

<p>{% trans "The libraries created inside a department are owned by the department itself, not by any individual user. So the system admin can assign storage quota to a department.

<h4 id="dept-members">{% trans "Department members" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktrans %}A normal member of the department can use the department just like a group. Each department is presented to its members as a group. A user can not only access to the libraries in the department he/she belongs to, but also the libraries in the parent departments of his/her department. For example, if John is in the "EMEA" sub-department under the "Sales" department, and "Sales" is a sub-department under the company "ACME", John can then access to the groups "EMEA", "Sales" and "ACME". The groups for departments are marked with a "building" icon next to its name.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
