<p>{% trans "Some organizations consist of complex department hierarchy. There are usually two common use cases for file management in these organizations:" %}</p>
<ul>
  <li>{% trans "There should be a common file sharing space for the organization. The folder hierarchy should map the department hierarchy. There will be separate folder or space assigned to each department." %}</li>
  <li>{% trans "The sharing space should be owned and managed by the organization, but not individual employees. So that the ownership of files doesn't have to be changed when an employee leaves the organization." %}</li>
</ul>
<p>{% blocktrans %}Before version 6.3.0, files in Seafile can only be owned by individual users and shared to other users or groups. In 6.3.0, we introduce the "Departments" feature to meet the above two use cases. This new feature works side by side with the existing sharing features. {% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans "The system admin can set up the department hierarchy in two ways: manual setup or import from Active Directory." %}</p>
<p>{% trans "The system admin can create any number of top level departments and create any levels of sub-departments under each department. And each level of department can be populated with members. The system admin can set the role of each member to 'member' or 'admin'. We'll introduce how a department admin can manage department later." %}</p>
<p>{% blocktrans %}The system admin can also import the hierarchy from OUs (Organizational Units) in AD. Please refer to "Sync OU to departments" section in <a href="https://manual.seafile.com/deploy_pro/ldap_group_sync.html" target="_blank">LDAP Group Sync documentation</a>. Each OU will be imported as a department. And the sub-OUs under an OU will be imported as sub-departments. Department libraries can be automatically created in the import process. {% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans "The file libraries created inside a department are owned by the department itself, not by any individual user. So the system admin can assign storage quota to a department. The total size of all the libraries in a department cannot exceed the storage quota. <strong>Please note that the quota of sub-department doesn't depend on the quota of its parent department.</strong>" %}</p>
<h5 id="create-and-manage-shared-libraries-in-departments">{% trans "Create and manage shared libraries in departments" %}</h5>

A user can not only access to the libraries in the department he/she belongs to, but also the libraries in the parent departments of his/her department. For example, if John is in the "EMEA" sub-department under the "Sales" department, and "Sales" is a sub-department under the company "ACME", John can then access to the groups "EMEA", "Sales" and "ACME". The groups for departments are marked with a "building" icon next to its name. See the screenshot below for details.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <li>{% trans "Change library name" %}</li>
  <li>{% trans "Share a library to users or groups outside of this department. This is very useful for cross-department collaboration." %}</li>

<h4 id="dept-members">{% trans "Department members" %}</h4>
<p>{% blocktrans %}A normal member of the department can use the department just like a group. Each department is presented to its members as a group.
